# EDA-on-US-Accidents
US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis

This is analysis will go through the US Accidents database from Kaggle.com which has about 2.8 million counts of data. I will use this data to do EDA and find possible conclusions.

I plan on using numpy, python, pandas, and visual libraries like seaborn and matplotlib

This dataset does not contain data about the state New York.
